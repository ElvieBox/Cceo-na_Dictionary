##Synopsis##
This project aims to make the language of Cceo-na more accessible and easy to use
Due to the official website's lack of capabilities, accessing the original Cceo-na dictionary can prove difficult
This project tries to address those issues by creating a more well-supported website for translation (and possibly a web extension in the future)


##What is Cceo-na?##
Magacc Cceo-na is the main language of the fantasy world of Ccava-tawre 
It is made completely by Hathor, a close friend of mine, and has been expanding over the course of years
You can see the official page (which stays always current, unlike this project) in the link below

##Support##
Because this runs asynchronously from the official page, current definitions and words may become out of date
If you know me personally, please message me if you want it updated
